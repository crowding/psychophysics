% MouseTraceDemo2
%
% ___________________________________________________________________
% 
% Draw a curve with the mouse. Same as MouseTraceDemo, but asks
% Screen('Flip') to not clear the framebuffer after flip. This way,
% we don't need to redraw the whole mousetrace in each frame.

% HISTORY
%                       
% 4/23/05  mk       Derived from MouseTraceDemoOSX: Uses new "Don't clear" mode of Flip.
%                   to avoid redrawing the whole past mousetrace after each
%                   Flip --> Faster.
